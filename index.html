      <h2 id="About">Bio</h2>
      <p class="para">My name is Aaron Solarz, I was born at St. Luke'sâ€“Roosevelt Hospital, which is a block away from
         Columbus Circle and two blocks from Lincoln Square. Every day of my young life I would frequent the Museum of Natural History with my mother. Eventually, I ended up moving around Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens experiencing lots of different lifestyles and cultures which shaped me into the person I am now.  </p>

      <h3>Intrests</h3>
      <p class="para">
         Living in the capital of world culture you pick up a lot of different interests. I really enjoy exploring the city, taking long walks between boroughs. Seeing the architecture of the different neighborhoods is really cool to do especially to wrap your head around it's all in the same city. I also have an appreciation of art, music, and food. I frequent going to museums and outdoor street art. Activities I do for fun also include hiking, biking, and swimming.

         On my different adventures, I make sure to take lots of photos for a memory of the experience. Below I will be featuring different photos of me and places I've been.
